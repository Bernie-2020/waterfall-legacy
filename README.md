# waterfall-legacy
## BACKGROUND
Over the course of the campaign, the Bernie Sanders texting program sent more than 260 million text messages, including messages for the ID program, GOTV, and event recruitment. All data related to events and organizing were pulled through the ‘waterfall’ process. Developed on Beto O’Rourke’s 2018 campaign the Waterfall process funneled local supporters into events deemed highest priority first, with remaining supporters funneled into lower priority events while considering both distance and event capacity. The goals of the waterfall system were to maximize turnout while supporting as many events as possible, avoid oversaturation by sending people one to two asks per week, and to ensure that  high priority events received necessary support. 

This repository holds the master query used for allocation and the python script used to automate our process.
